            <description><![CDATA[<p>If youâ€™ve been hunting for a fresh, secure, and lightweight operating system, then freiOS might just be the breath of fresh air you need. Built with simplicity, speed, and security in mind, freiOS isnâ€™t just another OS â€” itâ€™s a platform designed for users who value efficiency, sustainability, and privacy.</p><h3>A Modern Approach to OS Design</h3><p>What really sets freiOS apart is its focus on performance without compromising security.

            <title><![CDATA[koyu.space was still here all the time â€“ now as a PDS!]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>koyu.space has been quietly present for a while, but itâ€™s been a little less vocal about its existence lately. Thatâ€™s changing now. koyu.space has evolved into a Personal Data Server (PDS), making it part of the decentralized social web.</p><h2>What does that mean?</h2><p>koyu.space now operates on the <a href="https://atproto.com/">Authenticated Transfer Protocol (AT Protocol)</a>, the same protocol that powers <a href="https://bsky.app/">Bluesky</a>. Unlike traditional social media platforms, where all your data is locked into a single companyâ€™s walled garden, a PDS lets you have more control over your information. Youâ€™re not just the product â€“ youâ€™re the one holding the keys to your own data.</p><p>If you were part of koyu.space before, or youâ€™re curious about whatâ€™s different now, Iâ€™m opening up invites for the next chapter of this journey! If youâ€™d like to join, just reach out to me, and Iâ€™ll send you an invite.</p><h2>Bluesky vs. Mastodon</h2><p>While weâ€™re on the topic of decentralized platforms, letâ€™s talk a bit about how Bluesky compares to Mastodon â€“ two popular alternatives to traditional social media.</p><p>Both are part of the Fediverse, but Bluesky runs on the AT Protocol, while Mastodon uses ActivityPub. The AT Protocol offers some key advantages:</p><ol><li><strong>Improved Scalability and Performance</strong>: Blueskyâ€™s protocol is designed with scalability in mind. It handles large volumes of traffic and user data with greater efficiency, making it a smoother experience for users. Mastodon, on the other hand, can sometimes struggle with performance due to its decentralized nature, especially on smaller instances.</li><li><strong>Better Data Control</strong>: The AT Protocol gives users more control over their data. It allows for features like private profiles, content moderation at the individual level, and greater customization. Mastodon does offer some of these features, but Blueskyâ€™s implementation is more streamlined and accessible.</li><li><strong>Ease of Use</strong>: Blueskyâ€™s user interface is sleek and designed with simplicity in mind. Itâ€™s easy to navigate, and you donâ€™t have to worry about joining a specific instance or server to participate. Mastodon can be more complicated for newcomers because it requires joining specific instances that have different rules, policies, and content moderation standards.</li><li><strong>Cross-Platform Compatibility</strong>: Bluesky, due to its protocol design, is built to be more compatible with other platforms and social networks in the future. It provides a strong foundation for expanding the decentralized web. Mastodon has made incredible progress, but its ecosystem still feels somewhat segmented.</li><li><strong>Storage Efficiency</strong>: One of the standout advantages of Bluesky is that it doesnâ€™t fill up your storage the way Mastodon can. Mastodonâ€™s backend is notoriously inefficient, and my previous instance on Mastodon collected over <strong>3TB</strong> of data before it was shut down. This massive amount of data just from running an instance made it increasingly difficult to maintain and scale. Blueskyâ€™s more efficient infrastructure ensures that data doesnâ€™t accumulate unnecessarily, making it far easier to manage.</li></ol><p>That said, both Bluesky and Mastodon are excellent options for those looking to move away from centralized social media. It all comes down to what you value more: performance and scalability, or community-driven moderation and openness.</p><p>If youâ€™re ready to explore a more decentralized way of socializing, join koyu.space and start engaging with a new kind of platform.</p><p>See you there! ðŸš€</p><p>[block]bluesky-embed-1[/block]</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Back in the Ink: A Fresh Start with Splatoon 3]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>For a while, my Switch Lite sat forgotten, gathering dust in the corner. I had moved on to other things, including The Finals, my competitive shooter of choice on Linux. But a recent disasterâ€”when The Finals completely broke after a frustrating updateâ€”finally pushed me to dust off my old console. The game wouldnâ€™t even launch anymore, and after countless tweaks to make it work on Linux, I was done. I needed something fresh, and thatâ€™s when I found Splatoon 3.</p><p></p><p>Iâ€™ve never been part of the Splatoon craze. I missed the hype around the first two games, never owned a Wii U, and didnâ€™t get into the series until the third installment. But once I fired up Splatoon 3, I was hooked immediately. This game is something else.</p><p></p><p>The vibe of Splatoon 3? Electric. The city is vibrant and full of life, and the music is a hyperactive blend of squid-pop that matches the action on screen. But beyond the charming aesthetic, the core gameplay is what keeps me coming back. Itâ€™s a turf war where your weapon of choice is ink, and the goal is to cover as much ground as possible while splatting opponents. Itâ€™s addicting. The strategy involved in choosing your weapons, balancing your loadout, and coordinating with teammates makes it feel less like a simple shooter and more like a competitive dance with ink and paint.</p><p></p><p>And now, with the official announcement of the Switch 2, Iâ€™m even more excited. Sure, there have been rumors and leaks for months, but the real deal is finally here. As we inch closer to its release, I canâ€™t help but imagine how Splatoon 3â€™s ink-splattering chaos will look on a beefier console with better graphics and smoother framerates. But despite the hype for the new hardware, thereâ€™s something oddly satisfying about revisiting a system thatâ€™s past its prime. Itâ€™s like rereading a favorite book before you dive into a new seriesâ€”familiar but still thrilling.</p><p></p><p>For now, though, Iâ€™m content to stay in the world of Splatoon 3. Itâ€™s the right game at the right time. Iâ€™m having a blast dodging rollers, launching Tenta Missiles, and trying to keep up with the player whoâ€™s always just a little bit too good. The ink might dry eventually, but right now, Iâ€™m just soaking in every colorful, chaotic moment.</p><p></p><p>As for The Finals, Iâ€™ll be back once the game recovers from its latest break. Version 5.6 has completely broken the game on Linux, and until that gets patched, Iâ€™m staying in Splatoon 3â€™s world of ink-splattered mayhem. Hereâ€™s to new memories, one splash at a time.</p>]]></description>
